"""
a judgement page for group events where judges can view and judge group events.
It allows judges to view the group events, assign marks to each group, and submit their judgement.
a group event is an event where multiple participants can participate as a group.
each grp has same house. 
that is how the group is formed.
so when a group event is judged, the marks are assigned to houses.
each member gets the same marks as the group and same grade and rank.
this is just an easier way to mark events where multiple participants can participate as a group.
